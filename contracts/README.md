# auth-smart-contracts

## TODO

- Check if you can validate ownership of phone number and telegram ID as Osman did on Email
  - Check if those auth methods allow to sign the tx + nonce as challenge as we do for WebAuthn to avoid replay attacks
- Create relayer project to sponsor Near transactions
- Review nonce and message signed validation for ETH/SOl
